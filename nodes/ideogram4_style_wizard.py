"""Ideogram 4 style wizard.

A tiny "click-together" helper for the Ideogram 4 ``style_description`` fields. The whole UI lives in
the frontend (web/js/ideogram4_style_wizard.js): a button opens a chip-picker where the user toggles
aesthetics / lighting / medium / photo / art_style terms. On close the wizard writes those values
straight into a connected AI2Go Ideogram 4 Prompt Builder's widgets.

The node's own ``style`` output is wired into the builder's ``import_json`` only as the anchor that
tells the wizard which node to write into; it deliberately emits an empty string at runtime so the
builder keeps building from its own widgets (and the user's bounding boxes / color palette are never
wiped by the import). ``wizard_data`` just persists the picker state inside the workflow.

Visual chip-picker for Ideogram 4's style_description fields.

Click "Open Style Wizard" and toggle one or many chips per category (aesthetics, lighting,
medium, photo, art_style); each category also has an editable text field and a live JSON preview.
