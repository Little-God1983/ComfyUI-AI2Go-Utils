## Installation

Clone into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory and restart ComfyUI:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/Little-God1983/ComfyUI-AI2Go-Utils
```

No extra dependencies (it uses Pillow, already shipped with ComfyUI). It can coexist with
ComfyUI-KJNodes — both Ideogram 4 nodes run side by side without conflict.

## Nodes

### AI2Go Ideogram 4 Prompt Builder

A visual prompt builder for **Ideogram 4's structured JSON caption** format. Draw bounding-box
**regions** on a canvas, describe each one, and the node assembles the caption — with a full
scene-graph **Overview**, region **parenting**, and named **groups** layered on top.

**Outputs:** `prompt` (the caption JSON), `preview` (a rendered overlay image), `bboxes`
(pixel-space boxes for SAM3 / crop nodes), `width`, `height`.

![How it works](assets/How-It-Works.jpg)

#### Region editor (canvas)

- **Draw** by dragging; move and resize with handles; **Ctrl-drag** to force-draw over an existing box.
- Per-region **type** (object / text), description, verbatim text, and a **color palette**; editable
  bbox fields (pixels + the 0–1000 grid).
- **Multi-select** — shift-drag marquee, shift-click toggle; **Alt-click** cycles overlapping boxes;
  **Del** / **Ctrl+C·V·D** to remove / copy / paste / duplicate.
- **Lock** regions, composition **guides** (thirds / grid / golden ratio / spiral), **snap-to-grid**,
  and adjustable label & box styling.
- **Background**: a connected reference image, the **last generated image** ("Grab BG"), or the
  **live sampling preview** — with a brightness control.
- Dockable / pinnable / fullscreen panel, a live **token estimate**, and output settings
  (compact/pretty JSON, normalized/absolute coords, `yx`/`xy` bbox order).

#### Overview (scene tree)

- A persistent, collapsible panel listing **every region** — click a row to select it (synced both
  ways with the canvas), so you can pick and edit a region without nudging it.
- **Ctrl/Cmd-click** to multi-select, **Shift-click** for a range.
- Lock, duplicate, and delete from the list; **drag a row — or a whole multi-selection — onto another
  to nest it**; drop on the header to send back to root.

#### Parenting & groups

- **Parent** any region under another: move a parent on the canvas and its children follow. Deleting a
  parent promotes its children to the grandparent (no surprise subtree wipe).
- **Groups** — right-click the Overview → *Create group from selection* to wrap regions in a **named**
  container:
  - Move the group → everything moves; **resize the group → its members scale**.
  - **Duplicate** the whole group, or **mirror** its members **horizontally / vertically**.
  - Deleting a group keeps its children.
  - Groups are editor-only organizers — **never part of the exported prompt**. Toggle their frames on
    the canvas with **👁️** (hidden by default; always listed in the Overview).

#### Copy / paste & interop

- **Copy** / **Paste** the caption JSON, and save/load named **Templates** (stored server-side).
  Each template can carry an optional **preview image** — click 📷 in the Templates menu to pick one
  (it's center-cropped to a 200×200 webp), or just drop a matching `<template-name>.{webp,png,jpg,jpeg}`
  next to the template file and it's picked up automatically.
- Copies carry a small `_ai2go` sidecar that preserves the full layout (groups + hierarchy) for a
  **lossless AI2Go → AI2Go** round-trip, while staying **two-way compatible with ComfyUI-KJNodes**:
  KJNodes ignores the extra data and loads the flat scene, and KJNodes captions load here flat too.
  The sidecar never reaches the model prompt.

### AI2Go Ideogram 4 Style Wizard

A "click-together" helper for the **style fields** of an Ideogram 4 caption — so you don't have to type
`aesthetics` / `lighting` / `medium` / `photo` / `art_style` by hand.

- Wire the wizard's **`style`** output into a **Prompt Builder's `import_json`** input (the link just
  tells the wizard which builder to fill).
- Click **🪄 Open Style Wizard** to open a two-tab modal. On the **Pick styles** tab, toggle one or many
  chips per category (they're comma-joined) or type your own; a **search box** filters chips, a **live
  JSON preview** shows the assembled `style_description`, and a **status line** names the builder you're
  writing to (or warns if nothing's connected).
- **Photo vs. art_style** are both selectable; if you set both, a warning notes that only `photo` is
  applied (Ideogram allows only one).
- **Apply** pushes the picks to the connected builder without closing (handy for tweaking); **Apply &
  close** (and Esc / clicking the backdrop) does the same and closes. Either way the picks are
  **written straight into the builder's** style widgets — your bounding boxes, color palette, and
  `high_level_description` are left untouched, and the node emits an empty string at run time so the
  `import_json` wire never overwrites the builder's regions.

**Editable chip presets.** The chip lists live in
`ComfyUI/user/default/ai2go/ideogram4/WizardStylesDefault.json`. Edit them right in the wizard on the
**Edit presets** tab — add, rename, or delete chips per category, then **Save to file** (or **Discard** /
**Restore defaults**). You can also hand-edit the JSON (each entry's `key` must be one of `aesthetics`,
`lighting`, `medium`, `photo`, `art_style`). If the file is **missing or malformed**, the wizard falls
back to the built-in defaults and shows a warning (with the exact parse error) plus a **Restore
defaults** button that (re)creates the file.

### AI2Go Prompt Batch

Run a **list of prompts one at a time** across a queued batch — the text analog of the classic
"Load Image Batch + increment index" trick. ComfyUI has no real for-loop, so you queue N runs by hand
and this node walks the list, emitting one prompt per run.

**Outputs:** `positive`, `negative`, `index` (the 0-based index used this run — wire it into a
SaveImage filename so each file records *which prompt* made it).

![AI2Go Prompt Batch](assets/Batch.png)

#### Editing prompts

- A dynamic **row editor** (in the spirit of rgthree's Power Lora Loader): each row is a **positive**
  and **negative** text box side by side. **➕ Add Prompt** appends a row, **🗑** removes one, and the
  **⠿** handle drag-reorders. The node **auto-grows and auto-shrinks** to fit; stretch it wider for
  roomier boxes.
- **📥 Read from JSON** — wire a text/primitive node holding a JSON prompt list into the optional
  `json_in` socket, then click to **append** it to the rows.
- **🗑 Clear All** (directly under Read from JSON) wipes the list — click once to arm
  ("⚠ Sure? Click again"), click again within 4 s to confirm; it disarms itself otherwise.
- The rows are the source of truth; internally they serialize to the JSON array
  `[{"positive": "...", "negative": "..."}, ...]` (a bare string is treated as positive-only), stored
  in a hidden field that both saves with the workflow and drives execution.

#### JSON structure

The prompt list — whether typed into the rows or imported via **📥 Read from JSON** — is a JSON
**array**, one entry per queued run:

```json
[
  { "positive": "a red fox in the snow, highly detailed, 8k", "negative": "blurry, watermark" },
  { "positive": "a neon-lit city street at night, cinematic" }
]
```

- **`positive`** *(required)* — the prompt text; must be non-empty.
- **`negative`** *(optional)* — defaults to `""` when omitted or `null`.

The importer also accepts these convenience forms:

- A **bare string** entry is treated as positive-only — `["a red fox", "a neon city"]`.
- **`prompt`** works as an alias for `positive`.
- The array may be wrapped in an object — `{ "prompts": [ ... ] }`.

Each run emits the entry at `index` (0-based) and the batch walks `0, 1, 2, …`. Entries with an empty
`positive` are dropped when **Delete empty prompts** is on; otherwise they raise a "positive is empty"
error at run time.

#### Running a batch

1. Build the list, then click **🔍 Check for prompts** — it validates, counts N, resets the index to 0,
   and tells you how many runs to queue.
2. Set ComfyUI's **queue/run count to N** and run. The node advances `index` by 1 after each run
   (immune to the "Widget Value Control Mode" setting), walking 0, 1, 2… across the batch.

**Toggles.**

- **Reset index at batch start** (default on) — zero the index when a new batch is queued, so every
  batch starts from the first prompt.
- **Delete empty prompts** (default on) — drop rows with an empty positive on **Check** and just before
  a batch is queued, so blank rows never break a run or skew the count.

If the index ever overshoots the list (more runs than prompts), it clamps to the last prompt instead of
erroring.

### AI2Go Multi Loaders (Image, Audio & Video)

Drop **multiple files onto one node** and every file gets its **own output socket** — wire each
image, clip or video somewhere different in the same run. Six nodes, two flavors each:

| Node | Per file | Always |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi Image Loader** | `image_N` | `count` |
| **Multi Image Loader Advanced** | `image_N` + `mask_N` + `filename_N` | `count` |
| **Multi Audio Loader** | `audio_N` | `count` |
| **Multi Audio Loader Advanced** | `audio_N` + `filename_N` | `count` |
| **Multi Video Loader** | `video_N` + `audio_N` | `count` |
| **Multi Video Loader Advanced** | `video_N` + `audio_N` + `filename_N` | `count` |

- **Up to 8 files per node.** By default (`output_slots = auto`) sockets appear as you add files
  and disappear as you remove them. Files are uploaded into ComfyUI's `input/` folder (like the
  stock Load Image), so saved workflows survive restarts.
- **`output_slots`:** pin a fixed socket count (1-8) instead of `auto` to keep the sockets — and
  your wires — in place while you swap files around. Extra sockets with no file behind them
  output nothing, so don't wire more than you actually load; when the pinned count is lower than
  the number of loaded files, the extra files simply aren't reachable (no socket carries them).
- **Drop the files onto the field, or click it to browse** — same field does both; no separate
  add button.
- **Rows** show a thumbnail + pixel size (images) or a duration (audio). Drag the ⠿ grip to
  reorder, ✕ to remove, **Sort by name** for folder order. Row order = socket order.
- **Removing or reordering files shifts what each socket carries** — the node warns you in its
  status line whenever a change touches a socket that has a wire, so check your connections.
- **Per-row on/off toggle**, plus a **Toggle All** control above the list. Switching a row off is
  different from removing it: the row **keeps its socket position** — nothing shifts — and that
  socket simply outputs nothing (`None`) on the next run; `count` only counts the enabled files
  actually emitted. That's equivalent to leaving an **OPTIONAL** input unplugged, so it's safe for
  wires feeding optional inputs downstream. Don't switch off a row whose socket feeds a
  **REQUIRED** input — that node will fail on `None`.
- **Downscaling (image nodes):** set `downscale_mode` to `keep aspect ratio` (shrink keeping
  shape), `crop to square` (centered square) or `stretch to square` (forced square) and any image
  whose longest edge exceeds `max_size` is shrunk on load — `off` (the default) passes images
  through untouched. `keep aspect ratio` and `crop to square` never upscale; `stretch to square`
  may enlarge the shorter side (forcing a square does that). Masks are resized with their image;
  originals in `input/` are never modified.
- **Masks** (Advanced): inverted alpha, exactly like stock Load Image — files without an alpha
  channel yield the stock 64×64 empty mask.
- **Audio is never resampled** — each `audio_N` keeps its file's native sample rate.
- **`force_rate` (video nodes):** `0` (the default) leaves every clip at its own native frame
  rate, and `video_N` is handed back lazily without decoding a single frame — the free path. Any
  other value drops or duplicates frames so every clip runs at that rate while keeping its real
  running time (a 10s clip stays 10s), the same convention as VideoHelperSuite — but forcing a
  rate has to decode the clip's frames to do it, so it costs time and memory.
- **Video clips with no audio track** yield nothing on that file's `audio_N` socket — same as
  leaving an unplugged **OPTIONAL** input, so it's safe unless that socket feeds a **REQUIRED**
  input downstream.

### AI2Go Resolution Selector

Pick a model-valid **width/height** by aspect ratio and mode, and (optionally) push it straight into
a connected **Ideogram 4 Prompt Builder**.

- **Profiles** — `default` does no clamping (it just snaps each side to the **`snap_multiple`** field,
  default **8**, which is what most diffusion samplers require). Model profiles like **Ideogram 4**
  enforce their own rules (multiples of 16, 256–2048 px) and show a *"clamped to keep aspect"* warning
  when a request exceeds the cap. `default` is the default so the node is safe to drop into any
  workflow.
- **Modes** — `raw` (type width/height), `auto` (pick a ratio; edit one side, the other follows),
  `megapixel` (target megapixels + ratio; both computed).
- **Aspect ratios** — named presets from **1:1 (Square)** to **3:1 (Wide Panorama)**, including **21:9 (Cinemascope)**. The list is
  square + landscape only; the **`⟷` flip button** transposes to portrait (16:9 → 9:16) and swaps
  width/height, so there's no duplicated 1:1.
- The readout shows the resulting **W × H**, megapixels, and the effective ratio + orientation. Wire
  `width`/`height` into a Prompt Builder; edits push into its canvas live and also apply on execution.

### AI2Go Save Metadata (Civitai)

Two output nodes that save PNG(s) with an **A1111-style `parameters` text chunk** — the flat,
human-readable format Civitai actually parses to show the prompt and auto-link the checkpoint and
LoRAs. ComfyUI's stock Save Image embeds the raw `workflow`/`prompt` graph instead, which Civitai
can't reliably read back into a prompt — and for a dynamic workflow (our own **AI2Go Prompt Batch**
is the worst case: one graph, N prompts, disambiguated only by a run index) it's actively
misleading. These nodes trace the graph at save time to capture the **real prompt used on this
specific run**.

**AI2Go Save Metadata (Civitai)** (Basic) auto-traces everything — positive, negative, steps, CFG,
seed, sampler, scheduler, model, and LoRAs — by walking backward from the KSampler feeding the saved
image (falling back to "the only sampler in the graph" if that walk doesn't land on one). When the
positive/negative text comes from an **AI2Go Prompt Batch** node, the trace reads that node's
current `index` and resolves the exact line that ran for this queue item, not the whole batch list.

**AI2Go Save Metadata (Civitai) Advanced** adds optional override sockets — `positive`, `negative`,
`steps`, `cfg`, `seed`, `sampler_name`, `scheduler` — that win over the trace when wired. Wiring a
Prompt Batch node's `positive`/`negative` outputs straight into these sockets is the reliable path
for dynamic/batch prompts: no static-graph guessing, just the string that actually ran. Model and
LoRAs are always auto-traced on both nodes — a variable-length LoRA chain isn't practical to socket,
and it's static graph data regardless of which prompt ran.

The model/LoRA walk recognizes checkpoints and standalone diffusion models (**Load Diffusion Model** /
GGUF unet loaders), and picks up LoRAs from ComfyUI's stock **Load LoRA** (`LoraLoader` /
`LoraLoaderModelOnly`) as well as rgthree's **Power Lora Loader** and **Lora Loader Stack** — including
several LoRAs in one node. Disabled rows and empty (`None`) / zero-strength slots are skipped, matching
what actually loads.

#### What gets written

One `parameters` chunk, A1111 order:

```
{positive} <lora:name:weight> ...
Negative prompt: {negative}
Steps: …, Sampler: …, CFG scale: …, Seed: …, Size: …, Model hash: …, Model: …, Lora hashes: "...", Version: ComfyUI
```

Each traced LoRA is appended to the positive line as a `<lora:name:weight>` tag and listed again in
`Lora hashes:` — both signals Civitai uses to auto-link the resource. Unknown/unresolved fields are
omitted, never guessed; if something can't be traced (e.g. two KSamplers in the graph, or a dynamic
prompt source the tracer doesn't recognize), a warning names the unresolved field(s) in the ComfyUI
log / node progress text, so you know to wire the Advanced node's sockets.

#### Test button

Both nodes have a **🔎 Test detection** button that runs the same trace against the *live* editor
graph and previews positive/negative, steps/cfg/sampler/seed, model, LoRAs, and any unresolved
fields — so you can check exactly what will be saved before queuing a run.

#### `save_workflow`

Off by default. **Off** — the PNG carries only the Civitai `parameters` chunk. **On** — it also
embeds the ComfyUI `workflow`/`prompt` chunks, the same as the stock Save Image, if you still want
the graph recoverable from the file.

#### Model & LoRA hashing

Civitai matches a checkpoint/LoRA to its resource page by **AutoV2** — the first 10 hex characters
of the file's full SHA-256. Hashing a multi-GB checkpoint is slow, so hashes are cached in
`.hash_cache.json` (in the pack folder, git-ignored) keyed by path + size + mtime: the **first save
of a new checkpoint or LoRA pays the hashing cost once**; every save after that is instant.

> **Verification pending:** the AutoV2 hash flavor is the one Civitai's own docs index against, but
> end-to-end confirmation — uploading a real image and watching Civitai auto-link the checkpoint and
> LoRA(s) — is still a pending manual check.

#### Assumption

Both nodes assume **one KSampler** in the workflow. Multi-sampler graphs (e.g. a hires-fix pass with
two KSamplers) aren't disambiguated by the trace; wire the Advanced node's override sockets in that
case.
